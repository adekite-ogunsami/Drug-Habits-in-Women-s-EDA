üìä Substance Abuse Analysis Dashboard for Women
This project presents an interactive Streamlit dashboard and a predictive analysis tool focused on understanding substance use patterns among women. Leveraging a subset of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) dataset, the application provides insightful descriptive analyses, allows for predictive modeling of substance use likelihood, and offers comprehensive documentation on the dataset, technology, and team.

The primary goal is to explore how various factors such as parental presence, peer influence, and socioeconomic indicators correlate with and potentially influence substance use behaviors (specifically marijuana and alcohol) among female respondents.

‚ú® Features
Interactive Descriptive Analysis: Explore key demographic distributions, substance use prevalence (Marijuana and Alcohol), social factors, socioeconomic impacts, and treatment-related behaviors through dynamic and interactive charts and metrics. Filters are available to drill down into specific population segments.

Predictive Modeling: Utilize a pre-trained Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of marijuana or alcohol use for an individual based on a set of input characteristics. The page also displays the model's coefficients, indicating the influence of each factor.

Comprehensive Documentation: A dedicated section providing detailed information on:

Dataset Details: Overview of the NSDUH dataset, key variables used, and their classification (categorical vs. numerical).

Technology Stack: An interactive display of all the tools and libraries used in the project, with logos and descriptions.

Team Members: Introduction to the project team, including their roles and contributions.

Project Roadmap: Outlining current functionalities and future enhancements.

Resources & Materials: Access to relevant project documents (e.g., proposals, reports, presentations) embedded directly within the application for easy viewing.

Clean User Interface: Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and responsive user experience with custom styling and hidden default Streamlit elements for a cleaner look.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

pip (Python package installer)

Downloading the Project
You can download this project in two ways:

Clone the repository (recommended for developers):

git clone https://github.com/adekite-ogunsami/Drug-Habits-in-Women-s-EDA.git
cd Drug-Habits-in-Women-s-EDA # Navigate into the project directory

Download as a ZIP file:
